<h1>The Best Movies According to Ankit</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>This is a really great movie about life, love and friends.</p>
<h3>The Adam Project</h3>
<p>Comes under the sci-fi genre and really cool concept about time travelling is shown in this movie.</p>
<h3>Spider-man : No Way Home</h3>
<p>Out of all the marvel movies I found this one to be really emotional, and it also combines all three of the spider-mans which also adds a really great nostalgic factor to the movie as well.</p>
